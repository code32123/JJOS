# JJOS
An operating system/file manager/API for M5Stack

This was an old project built on the https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack_MicroPython firmware, which is long abandoned due to complexity and seemingly insurmountable issues.
It lives on with the https://github.com/code32123/M5Stack-Games project, which features:
 + Custom display and SDCard drivers that play nice together
 + Bootmenu that can load to a different app using cwd
 + Snakey, 3DMaze, wireless access demos, and many more!
 + Doesn't rely on m5stack software at all, only uses a display driver module for micropython
